Brenton Lake
Two Job Listings:

		The first job that I found is a software engineer at Blizzard games. I am passionate about video games and I would get to use the skills I have learned in this class and apply them into a career that I feel I would really enjoy. I would grateful to be working in a job that uses my talents toward something I really enjoy. I also know someone who works at Blizzard and from what I have heard it is a great environment to work in.
		
		The second job I found that I would really love to work at is called Zync Up. It is a start up out of Austin and the job is for a front end developer. I really enjoy the front end of developing because I get to see a result of something I created. I believe that I could strive and really be an asset to a new start up and I like the whole start up business vibe.
